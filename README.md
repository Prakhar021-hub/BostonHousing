# Boston House Price Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project to predict housing prices in Boston using Linear Regression. This project includes data preprocessing, model building with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment via a Flask-based web application.

### Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Linear Regression with Ridge/Lasso regularization
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation (RÂ², RMSE, MAE)
- Interactive web app built with Flask

### Tech Stack
Python ,Pandas, NumPy ,scikit-learn ,Matplotlib, Seaborn ,Flask , HTML(for creating html form )

### Future Improvements
- Host the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Render)
- Add more models for comparison
- Include advanced feature engineering
- Improve frontend UI/UX
